        <h2>Problem Background</h2>
        <p><b>What are we trying to achieve?</b> We are trying to show an example application of the convex hull problem as it relates to security. In this case, the setting is that there will be several policemen trying to find prison escapees and the convex hull represents the "secured perimeter".</p>
        <p><b>What are our inputs/outputs?</b> Our project result is an interactive visualization. You can download the .exe file to run on Windows or .apk file to run on Android and use the interactive buttons to drive the UI. The Windows files can be found <a href="windows.zip">here</a> and Android files can be found <a href="android.zip">here</a>.</p>
        <p>There exist many applications of this problem, but we haven't found anything similar available on the public domain.</p>
        <p>More specifically, the algorithm that we've used to solve the convex hull problem, is Jarvis' March, otherwise known as the gift wrapping algorithm. We originally wanted to implement Chan's algorithm, but it turned out to be extremely complicated especially given the fact that speed is not necessarily a big issue here (in large simulations, our bottleneck is graphical capability of rendering all the models rather). Since the outputs are generally small (e.g. a police force is usually less than 1000 in an average sized town), we decided that Jarvis' March was the appropriate approach. The pseudocode for our approach can be found <a href="README.md">here</a>. A presentation showing simple visualizations can be found <a href="presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
