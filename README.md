# convex-hAR
Orens Xhagolli and Aishwary Pramanik
### Project Description
We are trying to combine a visualization of the Convex Hull Problem using Augmented Reality(AR). The setting is that the user will look at a given map from a top down view and random soldiers/policemen will spawn on the map: We will then visualize in real time at least one convex hull algorithm running to find the "secure perimeter". We believe this will be a good demostration to show that such problems can be extended and used in many different fields, including national/public security. The aim for this project to be a fun pedagogical tool, that will provide a real-world setting for the user, in order to communicate some common sense as to how the convex hull algorithms actually work.

### Timeline
The project will be divided into 2 major parts:
- AR Research & Development (Aishwary)
- Technology (CH) Research & Development (Orens)
 
However, the timeline for both will be similar even before we converge them into the same project. The following is a week-by-week breakdown of what we are trying to achieve and how.
- Week 4: Finalize idea and timeline.
- Week 5: Read upon any existing research papers and tools that are out there. Find out if there is anything similar to what we are trying to build and come up with a list of stengths and weaknesses.
- Week 6: Finalize detailed presentation of findings. Build visualizations and concept art of final product.
- Week 7-8: Start a naive solution implementation. Details to be updated on Week 6.
- Week 9: Bug-fixes + Alpha release. This will be an extremely Minimal Viable Product compared to the final product, but it should provide us with an idea of what the big roadblocks will be. Presentation for Week 10 to be finalized this week.
- Week 10: Presentation + Work evaluation. We will analyze what went well and what went wrong in the past 3 weeks and reflect upon our work and plan new features.
- Week 11-13: Finalize new feature/improvement implementation. (We want to leave this slightly open-ended in order to account for any delays and changes that might come up)
- Week 14: Finalize release, bug fixes and presentation.

### Workload balancing
Since the project consists of 2 major components, breaking the work down becomes a lot easier. The basic assumption is that there will be a lot of cross-debugging and co-working sessions for both parts, but mainly Aishwary will be responsible for AR implementation & visualizations and Orens will be responsible for the Convex Hull algorithm performance and implementation.
